Description: Provides functions for working with ecological data
    collected as part of the Brazilian "PPBIO" program.
    Integrates various ecological, spatial and data management 
    functions to provide user friendly outputs. Depends heavily on
    ecological (e.g. vegan), spatial (e.g. sp and raster) and
    data management (e.g plyr, reshape2) packages.
